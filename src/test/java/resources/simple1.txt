Images of two political prison camps in North Korea were released.

Some of the camps have grown larger. The bigger one now stretches five hundred square kilometers.
It’s thought that up to two hundred thousand prisoners, including children, are being tortured and killed.

The political prison camps in North Korea are very important to the government which wants to keep control over its population.

A human rights group is calling on the North Korean government to close down the camps, but North Korea simply denies the camps exist.

Difficult words: stretch - cover a large area, torture - to hurt someone, deny - say that something isn’t true.
